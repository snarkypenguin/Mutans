Simulation models are often comprised of a number of distinct interacting 
processes.  Traditional methods will usually address these process either
by coupling them in an integrated way, or by connecting them loosely in
a fashion characterised by "individual-based" models.

In this discussion, we consider the state space of the model as a
whole, and the more restricted state spaces of the components which
comprise the model.  Alternative submodels for a component may have a
part of the relevant component's state space in which it performs
poorly or well relative to other submodels for that component.

We construct a commutative non-unital ring with tree a metric
that has trees as its elements which are used to represent loci in 
state spaces and states associated with the model and its
potential submodels.  With this structure we are able to define
objective functions which reflect the utility of submodels with
respect to the state of the model and its components.

This work can be readily applied to agent-based ecosystem models,
cellular automata, models of population dynamics which are coupled
with environmental drivers, models of human activities, and models of
physical or mechanical systems. There may be many candidates for the
submodel used to represent a particular component of such and
ensemble, and the different candidates may have quite different
strengths and weaknesses.

The thesis incorporates two published papers demonstrating the utility
of the approach and two chapters which extend the work and provide
a realised framework for further exploration and modelling work.

An appendix is included, containing an example model model using the
tree-ring with objective functions for submodels, the model as a
whole, and submodel state maintenance.
