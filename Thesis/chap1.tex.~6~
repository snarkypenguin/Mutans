\section{Overview and introduction}

The primary aim of this thesis is to build an example mechanism which
may be used to mediate changes in the mathematical or algorithmic
structure of a model of a complex system. A simple uptake-depuration
model of organisms which migrate through a contaminant field is
presented both to develop the notions and to demonstrate the basic
utility of such a mechanism.  Models of complex systems typically
incorporate in their algorithms code to deal with fundamentally
different dynamics which may arise. The models used as examples in
this thesis deal fundamental changes in dynamics by changing the
component used --- a number of agents (instances of
submodels)\footnote{In this thesis, we will use \emph{model} to refer
  to a collection of of components which, together, simulate a
  system. The term \emph{submodel} will generally refer to a largely
  discrete component of a model, and it can be viewed as a model in
  its own right.  In some sense we can view submodels as the abstract
  or \emph{in potentia} representations, and \emph{agents} are
  specific, \emph{in esse} instances of submodels.} associated with
individual contact with a contaminant plume might be substituted for a
population agent which has no code path of its own to deal with
contaminant uptake or depuration.

Representing the state of the model, either as a whole or of its
constituent parts, is not simple: not only may the components of the
model vary through time, but their own dependences on other components
may change as the state of the model changes: a model which contains a
``whale spotting'' tourism venture may follow the activities of whales
at particular times of the year, but be utterly indifferent to them at
times when there is little likelihood of their presence in an
accessible location. Similarly, the association of entities
represented by a population-based model needs to be maintained if the
population disaggregates into super-individual-based or
individual-based agents.

These factors make a simple vector-based encoding mechanism for the
states of a model and its components awkward, thus we turn to a metric
space over a \rng\footnote{We use \rng\ to denote a ring without a
  multiplicative indentity element.} of trees with a finite number of
weighted, labelled nodes. This simplifies the comparison of possible
component mixes for a given global state, and makes available any
algorithms (such as for clustering) which depend only on ring
properties, excluding those that need a multiplicative unit.

Any attempt to assess the relative merit of a number of possible
component mixes for a model relative to its current state must have
some way of incorporating the necessary dependencies arising from the
effects of the current state on the , and be able to calculate (in
some sense) the incremental costs of change.

\section{Historical work}

\cite{Bobashev2007hybrid} describes an early model in epidemic
simulation, in which the representation of populations of human beings
changes according to a set of simple rules. This model demonstrates
that there is an advantage to changeing representation in terms of
computational efficiency and the fidelity of the model. Like the model
in \ref{chap2}, the rule governing the switching from one
representation to another is based on a threshhold value: a change
occurs when a 

The primary operational model underpinning the work in
\cite{Fulton2009crossingscales}, uses changing representations for
migrating whales.
