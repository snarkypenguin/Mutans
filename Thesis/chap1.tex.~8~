\section{Overview and introduction}

The primary aim of this thesis is to demonstrate a mechanism which can
be used to mediate changes in the mathematical or algorithmic
structure of a model of a complex system. A simple uptake-depuration
model of organisms which migrate through a contaminant field is
presented in Chapter \ref{cap2} to explore the fundamental principles
and to demonstrate the utility of such a mechanism. In this thesis, we
will use \emph{model} to refer to a (possibly trivial) collection of
of components which, together, simulate a system. The term
\emph{submodel} will generally refer to a largely discrete component
of a model, and it can be viewed as a model in its own right.  In some
sense we can view submodels as the abstract or \emph{in potentia}
representations, and \emph{agents} are specific, \emph{in esse}
instances of submodels.


Traditional models of complex systems incorporate alternative code
paths or expressions to deal with fundamentally different dynamics
which may arise during a simulaton. This is usually accomplished by
embedding specific tests which determine which code path or expression
is appropriate.  Agent based models are often (but not universally)
constructed with distinct kinds of agents having quite distinct code
bases {\citep{netlogo,swarm,repast,mason,nws,ningaloo}.


The models used as examples in this thesis
deal with such changes by changing the component used --- a number of
agents (instances of submodels)\footnote{}
associated with individual contact with a contaminant plume might be
substituted for a population agent which has no code path of its own
to deal with contaminant uptake or depuration.

Representing the state of the model, either as a whole or of its
constituent parts, is not simple: not only may the components of the
model vary through time, but their own dependences on other components
may change as the state of the model changes: a model which contains a
``whale spotting'' tourism venture may follow the activities of whales
at particular times of the year, but be utterly indifferent to them at
times when there is little likelihood of their presence in an
accessible location. Similarly, the association of entities
represented by a population-based model needs to be maintained if the
population disaggregates into super-individual-based or
individual-based agents.

These factors make a simple vector-based encoding mechanism for the
states of a model and its components awkward, thus we turn to a metric
space over a \rng\footnote{We use \rng\ to denote a ring without a
  multiplicative indentity element.} of trees with a finite number of
weighted, labelled nodes. This simplifies the comparison of possible
component mixes for a given global state, and makes available any
algorithms (such as for clustering) which depend only on ring
properties, excluding those that need a multiplicative unit.

Any attempt to assess the relative merit of a number of possible
component mixes for a model relative to its current state must have
some way of incorporating the necessary dependencies arising from the
effects of the current state on the , and be able to calculate (in
some sense) the incremental costs of change.



\section{Historical work}

Many individual-based models incorporate data which represents
environmental characteristics and influences the behaviour of of the
individuals simulated. \citea{deangelis1978model} is an early example
which models individual fish movement in a static environment. Fish
movements are influenced by the temperature, level of dissolved oxygen
and food availability at each node in their immediate vicinity. The
values associated with each node in the grid are either specified
explicitly or defined by mathematical equations. From its early
inception, the individual-based modelling approach implicitly couples
different styles of model components.

The coastal marine ecosystem model in \cite{Gray06:1} used different
representations for the organisms which comprised the benthic habitat
based on their life-stage; this change was configured at
initialisation much like the environmental characteristics in
\cite{deangelis1978model}.  Juvenile biomass was represented by a
polygonal clouds which could change shape as they were advected. The
adult stage could be represented by several different submodels,
emphasising either speed or spatial fidelity. This illustrates the
change in representation which \emph{a priori} optimises for speed or
fidelity. The model is otherwise similar to conventional
agent-based modelling: agents making more agents is almost essential
in individual-based computational ecology.  \cite{Gray06:1} also
included dynamic migration from ``individuals'' to
``super-individuals'' as an attempt to reduce the computational
overhead of large simulations, but the implementation of this feature
was naive, and actually ran slower.

\cite{Bobashev2007hybrid} describes a model of epidemic simulation in
which the representation of populations of human beings changes
according to a set of simple rules. This model demonstrates that there
is an advantage to changeing representation in terms of computational
efficiency and the fidelity of the model. The model in Chapter
\ref{chap2} is similar, the rule governing the switching from one
representation to another is based on a threshhold value: a change
occurs when some monitored quantity (the number of infected
individuals or the proximity to plume, for example) crosses a
nominated boundary.  The primary operational model underpinning the
work in \cite{Fulton2009crossingscales} uses changing
representations for migrating whales. Other agents, specifically those
associated with management and with tourism activities, are depend on
agents representing whales to a greater or lesser degree according to
the time of year.
