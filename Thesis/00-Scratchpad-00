Traditional models of complex systems incorporate alternative code
paths or expressions to deal with fundamentally different dynamics
which may arise during a simulaton. This is usually accomplished by
embedding specific tests which determine the appropriate code paths or
expressions necessary at that moment.  The different ``kinds'' of
entities have their defining features spread through the corpus of the
model. In contrast, agent-based models usually collect an agent's
defining code and expressions into contained units (classes, for
example) and may make use of inheritance to reduce duplication
\citep{netlogo,swarm,repast,mason,nws,ningaloo}. This second approach
makes the process of changing representations much more straightforward.
