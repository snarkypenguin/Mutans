{Models which are collections of largely independent, interacting
submodels may spend significant amounts of real and simulated time
running submodels in regions where other representations of the
entities the submodels represent may perform better.  This thesis
demonstrates that even simple models may be improved by changing the
representation of entities within such an aggregate model according to
the the state of the system at a number of levels. \emph{Introduction,
Paper 1}

A commutative ring based based on a metric space with tree elements is
developed as a tool for encoding the pertinent state information
associated with a model configuration, the states of its components,
and the real or expected efficiencies of the possible representations
which may be used in the model as a whole.

An example model using a tree based technique is explored and used as
a platform for discussion. \emph{Paper 2}

The final chapter presents a fully formed model with detailed
application of the techniques described and alluded to in preceding
chapters. \emph{model description}

Actual implementation of the critical parts of the model are included
in the appendix.}
