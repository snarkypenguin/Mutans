\section{Overview}


\newpage
\section{New Section}
The primary aim of this thesis is to build an example mechanism which
may be used to mediate changes in the mathematical or algorithmic
structure of a model of a complex system. A simple uptake-depuration
model of organisms which migrate through a contaminant field is
presented both to develop the notions and to demonstrate the basic
utility of such a mechanism.

A vector space of trees is defined which we may use to encode the
state of a model at potential transition points




This new paragraph shows how to set \index{index items}index items
and \index{index items!subindex items} subindex items.

\subsection{New Subsection}
Here's a subsection with some simple maths $a^2+b^2=c^2$.

Some more text to check indent and show how references work
\cite{Williamson:STS}.

Here's how we place a figure (Figure \ref{fig:utas}) on the page.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\scalebox{.30}{\includegraphics{Utas_vert_BW}} \caption{
\label{fig:utas} The UTas logo}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

And finally, here's a table example (Table \ref{tab:taba}).
\begin{table}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
$n=$&2&3&4&5\\
\hline
$c$ (rad/day)&1.67&0.52&0.06&-0.17\\
\hline
period (days)&3.75&12.00&100.00&37.50\\

\end{tabular}
