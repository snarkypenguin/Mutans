 abstract = {We present tractable formulations for neighborhood models of annual plant population dynamic processes. These models are constructed from submodels, termed predictors, of individual plants. Fecundity and survivorship predictors give the fecundity and survivorship of an individual as a function of local population density. Dispersal predictors predict the dispersal pattern of a plant's maternal progeny and the survivorship of plants from seed to seedlings. We develop both computer models and analytically tractable models. Our computer models are designed to determine the population dynamic consequences of specific fecundity, survivorship and dispersal predictors. The analytical models are valid when dispersal is sufficiently large, and are used to explain the predictions of analogous computer models. We show through examples that the predictions of corresponding computer and analytical models may be virtually identical. Empirical tests of these models are practical because all model parameters and functional forms can be estimated with data obtained in a single year. We describe the experiments and statistical methods used to test a neighborhood model. Finally, we describe how neighborhood models can be used to address specific issues in plant ecology and discuss possible extensions of neighborhood theory.},

 abstract = {(1) Calibrated neighbourhood population dynamic models had predicted that monocultures of Abutilon theophrasti (velvet leaf) can exhibit oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. This hypothesis was tested both in field experiments and under controlled-environment conditions. The effect of soil nutrient levels on the population dynamics was observed in glasshouse experiments. (2) Seed-set-density relations have negative slopes for a wide range of plant densities, both in the field and under controlled conditions, indicating that oscillatory dynamics are possible. The negative slope occurs because the fecundity of an Abutilon individual is not directly proportional to its biomass but is actually proportional to its biomass minus a constant. Field populations are in a state of damped rather than persistent oscillations solely due to the effect of delayed germination of seeds. (3) Oscillatory responses are likely to be found in populations of annuals that lack seed dormancy, have high seed survivorship, grow in locations with high soil fertility, and have minimum plant-size thresholds for seed production. Populations of adult perennials may be less likely to fluctuate in response to changes in seed numbers.},
