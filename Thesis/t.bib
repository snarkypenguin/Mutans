%Abstract                 = {Estuaries {and} associated coastal waters support many essential fisheries, a fact which contributes to their disproportionately high economic value. They are, however, also among the most extensively modified {and} threatened of aquatic environments. Almost all have been strongly affected by human beings, {and} fisheries are an integral part of human activities on the coast. We have taken a global perspective in synthesizing the effects of fishing on estuaries {and} coastal waters. Rather than attempt to cover all regions of the world in detail, we review eight process-orientated categories affected by fishing, with case studies for each of them: target organisms, non-target organisms, nursery functions, trophic effects, habitat change, reduced water quality, human environment, {and} potential for local extinctions. Fishing in the estuarine {and} nearshore environment has clear impacts on the structure {and} functioning of these ecosystems, although other, non-fishing issues also effect these ecosystems. This creates multiple interactions {and} reinforces the need for an integrated approach to coastal zone management. Nonetheless, some form of fish-based action plan could be created, especially within estuaries, which would provide management objectives for a particular system.},

The behavioural and biological processes of pastoralists, regulators, livestock, grass and shrubs are modelled as well as the interactions between these components. The evolution of the rangeland system is studied under different policy and institutional regimes that affect the behaviour and learning of pastoralists, and hence the state of the ecological system. Adaptive agent models show that effective learning and effective ecosystem management do not necessarily coincide and can suggest potentially useful alternatives to the design of policies and institutions.}},

Our seas are highly dynamic, structured and complex systems. The seafloor consists of vast shelves and plains with huge mountains, canyons and trenches which dwarf similar structures on land. Ocean currents transport water masses many times larger than all rivers on Earth combined. In this report, the locations of the most productive fishing grounds in the World {\^{a}}`` from shallow, coastal waters to the deep and high seas {\^{a}}`` are compared to projected scenarios of climate change, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, intensity of fisheries, land-based pollution, increase of invasive species infestations and growth in coastal development.}},

%  Abstract                 = {Within the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna there has not been agreement on a mechanism for adjusting quotas for the resource. It has been proposed that development of a decision-rule-based management strategy is an issue of high priority, indeed a matter of urgency. Results are presented from an initial application of a Monte Carlo management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach aimed at developing a rebuilding strategy for the stock. Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) provides a substantial test of the power of this approach to develop a decision framework that can cope with large uncertainties about the current state of the stock and conflicting information from the fishery that is used in stock assessment. The results indicate that a robust feedback decision-making framework can be developed which ensures fast rates of recovery across the broad range of interpretations about stock dynamics and current status of the resource. Among the harvest strategies examined, the F0.2, F0.1, and SSB/R strategies were clearly the most robust and consistent in terms of recovery and sustainability. Fast recovery rates were only achieved with strategies that had catches substantially below 1998 levels. Within the strategies examined, little scope exists for improvement in yield without a direct loss in recovery performance. For the MSE approach to succeed, the operating, sampling, and conditioning model components must incorporate the full uncertainty about the real stock and the sampling processes appropriately. There is clearly scope for improving and broadening the way uncertainties have been handled in this initial examination. In particular, uncertainties associated with the catch-at-age, the relationship between the c.p.u.e. and true abundance, and the conditioning of the historical population sizes in the face of inconsistent historical data, need further development. As the MSE approach requires conditioning to historical data, full and appropriate incorporation of uncertainty into stock assessment and conditioning would lead to a better basis for developing and evaluating management procedures that will work.},

%  Abstract                 = {Ecosystem objectives in fisheries management usually flow from high-level national policies or strategies and international agreements. Consequently they are often broadly stated and hence are difficult to incorporate directly in management plans. Predicting the results of any management action is very uncertain because the dynamics of ecosystems are complex and poorly understood. Methods to design and evaluate operational management strategies have advanced considerably in the past decade. These management-strategy-evaluation (MSE) methods rely on simulation testing of the whole management process using performance measures derived from operational objectives. The MSE approach involves selecting (operational) management objectives, specifying performance measures, specifying alternative management strategies, and evaluating these using simulation. The MSE framework emphasizes the identification and modelling of uncertainties, and propagates these through to their effects on the performance measures. The framework is outlined and illustrated by three ecosystem-related applications: management of benthic habitats and broad fish community composition; by-catch of species of high conservation value; and food-chain interactions and dependencies. Challenges to be overcome before broader ecosystem-related objectives can be fully handled are discussed briefly.},
