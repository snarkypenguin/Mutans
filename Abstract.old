This thesis explores an avenue for increasing the efficiency in models
that are comprised of distinct, interacting submodels of the
model's components. These components may have several different
submodels which may serve to represent them in the ensemble. In this
discussion, we consider the state space of the model as a whole, and
the more restricted state spaces of the components which may comprise
the model.  Each of the possible submodels for a component may have a
part of the relevant component's state space in which it performs
poorly or well relative to other submodels for that component.

We construct a commutative ring (without an identity) over a metric
space that has trees as its elements as a vehicle for representing the
state spaces and individual states associated with the model and its
potential submodels.  With this structure we are able to define
objective functions which reflect the utility of submodels with
respect to the state of the model and its components.

Models which may be amendable to this interacting submodels. Examples
of this type of model include agent-based ecosystem models, cellular
automata, models of population dynamics which are coupled with
environmental drivers, models of human activities, and models of
physical or mechanical systems. There may be many candidates for the
submodel used to represent a particular component of such and
ensemble, and the different candidates may have quite different
strengths and weaknesses.

The thesis is organised in five chapters. The first chapter describes
the motivation for the work and words used as technical terms. It also
addresses previous work related to the thesis.  Two published papers
are also included as chapters. The first paper is included as the
second chapter, demonstrating the utility of the proposed strategy
with a basic presence/absence trigger in a simple model of contaminant
uptake and depuration in a migratory population. The second chapter
defines the commutative tree-ring and gives proofs of the ring
properties of the structure.  The second paper is included as the
fourth chapter, and it illustrates a more comprehensive strategy for
an adaptive simulation model using the tree-based metric space.  The
final chapter deals with the nature of objective functions, model
migration, state maintenance, and assessment strategies, and concludes
with a discussion of domains where this approach could be usefully
applied.

An appendix is included, containing an example model model using the
tree-ring with objective functions for submodels, the model as a
whole, and submodel state maintenance.
