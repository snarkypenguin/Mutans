The main component missing from a completed thesis is the section
dealing with applying conventional classification and
interpolation/extrapolation techniques to the trees which are used to
represent configurations and states of a system of submodels.  A
simple body of code to be used as reference material for this chapter
is under development, but is currently incomplete.

There is also a minor amount of "connective" text associated with placing
the two published papers within the context of the thesis.
