Octave extension for Chicken and Gambit Scheme


This library provides a simple interface for GNU/Octave use in
Chicken, Gambit, and Bigloo Scheme systems. The interface is meant to
be used as a graph utility using the GNU/Octave interface to
gnuplot. Comments and contributions are welcomed.

NEW! Version 0.6 now supports Bigloo.


Instructions: 

See octave.html


Versions:

0.6: Support for Bigloo added. conc and string-intersperse renamed
octave:conc and octave:string-intersperse to avoid name
clashes. octave:string-intersperse is now tail-recursive for gambit
and bigloo.

0.5: Corrected octave:mesh and octave:mesh-xyz issues in the
Chicken version.

0.4: Changed octave:stop. Added octave:stairs and octave:errorbar
functions.

0.3: Access to all Octave's supported file types to save the current
graph. Added octave:legend function. Checks for argument lengths in 2d
plot functions. Replaced gset with __gnuplot_set__ internal Octave
function.

0.2: Added 3d plotting functions (octave:mesh-xyz, octave:contour,
octave:imagesc) and an interface version (octave:version) function.

0.1: Initial version. Wrapper for most of the Basic Interface  functions.
