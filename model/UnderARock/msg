  "This first loads the basic files which build the modelling framework"
  "and the supporting function libraries.  It then loads the files which"
  "are specific to a particular model---submodels.scm, kernel.scm and"
  "mode-configuration.scm.  'submodels.scm' defines the object classes"
  "which are to be used, 'kernel.scm' contains the code which manages the"
  "execution loop, and 'model-configuration.scm' actually instantiates"
  "the entities in the model, configures them, and calls the kernel to"
  "begin the run.")
