framework --- (include "framework") is the first step in running the
			 model.  It *must* be included rather than loaded for the macros to work.

	In order:
		-- (load "sclos.o1")
	   	or
			(load "sclos.scm")

		--	(load "support.o1")
			or
			(for-each load '("preamble.scm" "framework.scm" "utils.scm" "units.scm" "sort.scm"
								"maths.scm" "integrate.scm" "matrix.scm" "postscript.scm"
								"basic-population.scm"))

	It then prints a prompt suggesting that running (load-model) is the next step.


preamble.scm --- defines a few routines that don't really fit well in other files.

framework.sck --- refines the "load" procedure and defines the basic
				  structure of the simulation system and initiates loading
				  the rest of the model when (load-model) is run.
