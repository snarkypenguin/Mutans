From framework-methods:

initialise -- initialises class/slot variables

run -- runs the agent for a nominated amount of time; there are
routines so that <objects> and <class>es cannot run

agent-prep -- ensures that its schedule for running is ok, and that
the agent is flagged as ready to run.

initialize -- sets the basic <agent> class variables so that the agent
can run in a reasonably way

 ... initialize-parent is passed through in the call chain so that we
 may initialise the parent state variables *after* the child's
 "initialise-with-an-s" is called, but before the child's "initialize"
 is called.  "initialise" is principally for setting default values of
 the child's state variables, so they are reasonable at the beginning
 of the initialisation process.

I will need
  IB representations for trees and the two animals (based on animal)

  Population based representations for trees, seeds and fruit
  at  global and cell-based levels.

  Need a supervisory agent which collects info from the IB animals
  (number, ages...) as a means of effecting the changes in fruit and seeds.  



Observations:
	Fruit decays and the pool of fruit must be replaced by mature trees
	seeds only happen when animals eat fruit
	seeds have a constant spoilage rate
