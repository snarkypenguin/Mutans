Most "initialize" definitions  have a form something like

     (model-method <doodlebug> (initialize self args)
            (initialise
               self (list 'state-flags '()
                          'subjective-time 0.0
                          'dt 1.0
                          'jiggle LastJiggle
                          'priority DefaultPriority
                          ....
                          )
                       )

            (initialize-parent)
            (initialise self args)
            )

The call to (initialise self args) initialises the slot-variable/value
pairs specified in arguments.  It would usually be a conceptual error
to set a slot-variable in a call to initialise in the first *and*
second call, but this is not trapped since it can be quite valid.
