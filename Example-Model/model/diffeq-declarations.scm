;-  Identification and Changes


;***** When you add things to this file (or any other *-declarations.scm file)
;***** you *must* run "make declarations.scm" or a more comprehensive make.
;*****
;***** This is because the model includes "declarations.scm" rather than the many
;***** other *-declaractions.scm files -- "declarations.scm" is filtered to exclude
;***** duplicate declarations, and this stops methods simply disappearing.
