  abstract =     "(1) Calibrated neighbourhood population dynamic models
                 had predicted that monocultures of Abutilon theophrasti
                 (velvet leaf) can exhibit oscillatory and chaotic
                 dynamics. This hypothesis was tested both in field
                 experiments and under controlled-environment
                 conditions. The effect of soil nutrient levels on the
                 population dynamics was observed in glasshouse
                 experiments. (2) Seed-set-density relations have
                 negative slopes for a wide range of plant densities,
                 both in the field and under controlled conditions,
                 indicating that oscillatory dynamics are possible. The
                 negative slope occurs because the fecundity of an
                 Abutilon individual is not directly proportional to its
                 biomass but is actually proportional to its biomass
                 minus a constant. Field populations are in a state of
                 damped rather than persistent oscillations solely due
                 to the effect of delayed germination of seeds. (3)
                 Oscillatory responses are likely to be found in
                 populations of annuals that lack seed dormancy, have
                 high seed survivorship, grow in locations with high
                 soil fertility, and have minimum plant-size thresholds
                 for seed production. Populations of adult perennials
                 may be less likely to fluctuate in response to changes
                 in seed numbers.",

  abstract =     "We present tractable formulations for neighborhood
                 models of annual plant population dynamic processes.
                 These models are constructed from submodels, termed
                 predictors, of individual plants. Fecundity and
                 survivorship predictors give the fecundity and
                 survivorship of an individual as a function of local
                 population density. Dispersal predictors predict the
                 dispersal pattern of a plant's maternal progeny and the
                 survivorship of plants from seed to seedlings. We
                 develop both computer models and analytically tractable
                 models. Our computer models are designed to determine
                 the population dynamic consequences of specific
                 fecundity, survivorship and dispersal predictors. The
                 analytical models are valid when dispersal is
                 sufficiently large, and are used to explain the
                 predictions of analogous computer models. We show
                 through examples that the predictions of corresponding
                 computer and analytical models may be virtually
                 identical. Empirical tests of these models are
                 practical because all model parameters and functional
                 forms can be estimated with data obtained in a single
                 year. We describe the experiments and statistical
                 methods used to test a neighborhood model. Finally, we
                 describe how neighborhood models can be used to address
                 specific issues in plant ecology and discuss possible
                 extensions of neighborhood theory.",

abstract = "Foraging methods are highly variable, but can be grouped into two modes: searching and ambush. While research has focused on the functioning of each mode, the question of how animals choose which to use has been largely neglected. Here we consider a forager that exploits prey that are patchily distributed in space and time. This forager can either sit and wait for prey to appear or search for prey, which is more likely to result in encounters with prey but costs more energy and/or exposes the forager to greater predation risk. The currency that natural selection appears to have optimized will be determined by the additional costs of searching and whether there is a risk of starvation. We therefore compare the predictions of models based on currencies that consider only energy and predation risk to state-dependent models in which energy reserves are used to trade off predation rate, starvation rate and investment in growth. The choice of currency qualitatively affects how mode should change when prey abundance and prey patchiness increase. We show how differing prey distributions can explain variation in effects of experimentally increasing prey abundance. Our work has several implications for the study of foraging mode, population dynamics and the methods used to assess population size. "

  abstract	= {Within the Commission for the Conservation of Southern
		  Bluefin Tuna there has not been agreement on a mechanism
		  for adjusting quotas for the resource. It has been proposed
		  that development of a decision-rule-based management
		  strategy is an issue of high priority, indeed a matter of
		  urgency. Results are presented from an initial application
		  of a Monte Carlo management strategy evaluation (MSE)
		  approach aimed at developing a rebuilding strategy for the
		  stock. Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) provides a
		  substantial test of the power of this approach to develop a
		  decision framework that can cope with large uncertainties
		  about the current state of the stock and conflicting
		  information from the fishery that is used in stock
		  assessment. The results indicate that a robust feedback
		  decision-making framework can be developed which ensures
		  fast rates of recovery across the broad range of
		  interpretations about stock dynamics and current status of
		  the resource. Among the harvest strategies examined, the
		  F0.2, F0.1, and SSB/R strategies were clearly the most
		  robust and consistent in terms of recovery and
		  sustainability. Fast recovery rates were only achieved with
		  strategies that had catches substantially below 1998
		  levels. Within the strategies examined, little scope exists
		  for improvement in yield without a direct loss in recovery
		  performance. For the MSE approach to succeed, the
		  operating, sampling, and conditioning model components must
		  incorporate the full uncertainty about the real stock and
		  the sampling processes appropriately. There is clearly
		  scope for improving and broadening the way uncertainties
		  have been handled in this initial examination. In
		  particular, uncertainties associated with the catch-at-age,
		  the relationship between the c.p.u.e. and true abundance,
		  and the conditioning of the historical population sizes in
		  the face of inconsistent historical data, need further
		  development. As the MSE approach requires conditioning to
		  historical data, full and appropriate incorporation of
		  uncertainty into stock assessment and conditioning would
		  lead to a better basis for developing and evaluating
		  management procedures that will work.},

		  (ABMS) has been applied to a variety of domains,
		  demonstrating the potential of this technique to advance
		  science, engineering, and policy analysis. However,
		  realizing the full potential of ABMS to find breakthrough
		  research results requires far greater computing capability
		  than is available through current ABMS tools. The Repast
		  for High Performance Computing (Repast HPC) project
		  addresses this need by developing a useful and useable
		  next-generation ABMS system explicitly focusing on
		  larger-scale distributed computing platforms. Repast HPC is
		  intended to smooth the path from small-scale simulations to
		  large-scale distributed simulations through the use of a
		  Logo-like system. This article's contribution is its
		  detailed presentation of the implementation of Repast HPC
		  as a useful and usable framework, a complete ABMS platform
		  developed explicitly for larger-scale distributed computing
		  systems that leverages modern C++ techniques and the ReLogo
		  language.},

  abstract	= "Ecosystem objectives in fisheries management usually flow
		  from high-level national policies or strategies and
		  international agreements. Consequently they are often
		  broadly stated and hence are difficult to incorporate
		  directly in management plans. Predicting the results of any
		  management action is very uncertain because the dynamics of
		  ecosystems are complex and poorly understood. Methods to
		  design and evaluate operational management strategies have
		  advanced considerably in the past decade. These
		  management-strategy-evaluation (MSE) methods rely on
		  simulation testing of the whole management process using
		  performance measures derived from operational objectives.
		  The MSE approach involves selecting (operational)
		  management objectives, specifying performance measures,
		  specifying alternative management strategies, and
		  evaluating these using simulation. The MSE framework
		  emphasizes the identification and modelling of
		  uncertainties, and propagates these through to their
		  effects on the performance measures. The framework is
		  outlined and illustrated by three ecosystem-related
		  applications: management of benthic habitats and broad fish
		  community composition; by-catch of species of high
		  conservation value; and food-chain interactions and
		  dependencies. Challenges to be overcome before broader
		  ecosystem-related objectives can be fully handled are
		  discussed briefly.",
