First, let me apologies for not actually managing all this very
well. I am notoriously bad at this sort of thing, and I am not good at
"pushing things along" ... I am accused of being entirely too task
focussed for my own good. Apologies, too, for the delay in emailing
this to you --- I've been breathing life back into my computer this
week and have just now managed to make my historical email
and work accessible. 

In August of 2011, Simon and I had "Increasing model efficiency by
dynamically changing model representations" in \textbf{Environmental
Modelling and Software} (DOI:10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.08.012), and I
believe that this is included in the progress reports to date.

I can't recall just when Barry Gardner retired, but I know that the
last review was done just before he did. We did it in a little room
with a photocopier or printer, perhaps off toward the geologists's
lair on level two or three?

I can fill in the missing reports relatively quickly once I can get to
them. I will use previous years as a model to address the points for
the missing years so that we can deal with things quickly.

During 2012, 2013 and much of 2014, I was working on a mathematical
structure to encode the state of a diverse set of submodels. My aim
was (and is) to allow us to use already existing techniques (such as
clustering) to assess how the current state of a set of models
compared with "known-good" and "known-bad" configurations. The result
is a (commutative) ring whose elements are rooted trees which form a
metric space. I believe that this structure will be amenable to common
clustering and categorising techniques.

At the end of August in 2014, I was invited to submit a paper for a
special issue of \textbf{Frontiers in Environmental Science}, on the
propositions rooted in the first paper. From Sept. 2014 to Sept 2015,
I constructed a credible thought-model (and have partially implemented
it), finished the groundwork on the tree-structures and wrote the
paper (DOI:10.3389/fenvs.2015.00058) which was published in Aug 2015.


I submitted a request to sispend study sometime in the second half of
2014 -- I cannot actually see the status of the request in iGrad. I
prodded Simon in face-to-face meetings after a month or so had elapsed
and emailed him in January and was assured that it would be sorted out
soon, and would retroactively apply from Sept. 2014. Unfortunately, I
didn't draft the submission on my machine and cut-and-paste it in as I
usually do, though I do have emails discussing the process (or lack of
process).

Many thanks, I hope it is possible to sort this out,

Best regards,

Randall
